      <p><i>~I am curious about prescribing data... </i> </p>
      
      <p> <b>A First- Glance at NHS GP Prescribing of Sleep Medications: Z drugs and Benzodiazepines (2020–2025) Using OpenPrescribing</b></p>
      <p> I have worked on a range of data-driven projects for some time, OpenPrescribing was entirely new to me.  Curious about who it was built for, how it works, and whether I could find something interesting or inspiring,  I decided to dive in and give it a try. From time to time, I explored OpenPrescribing, mostly to become familiar with its features. I found it to be an excellent example of how simplicity and power can coexist in a well-designed tool, and I was impressed by its clean, intuitive interface and surprisingly strong analytical capabilities.</p>
      <p>I took a closer look recently at OpenPrescribing after coming across a topic that drew my interest - sleep medications. Although sleeping pills are prescribed to aim sleep and support health, research suggests that deprescribing unnecessary sleep drugs can improve well-being and benefit in older adults [1], as these medications are linked to cognitive decline and increased injury risk [2-5] . Interested in prescribing patterns and potential regional differences, I looked into GP prescriptions for Z-drugs (Zopiclone/Zimovane, Eszopicione, Zolpidem) and Benzodiazepines in England between September 2020 and August 2025, using the OpenPrescribing platform.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://openprescribing.net/"> OpenPrescribing </a>, click “Start analysing” to launch the “Analyse” interface. Enter the drug names and select lists containing all available formulations (tablets, capsules, liquids, and suspensions) across all doses. Then choose “versus – total list size,” highlight “NHS England Region” and click “Show me the data” to generate figures and a downloadable CSV data file. Following this process, I obtained Figure 1 (line chart), which shows the prescribing trend for Z-drugs and Benzodiazepines per 1,000 patients by region from 2020 to 2025. Figure 2 (map) and Figure 3 (bar chart) present snapshots of prescribing rates across regions in September 2020 (start) and August 2025 (end). </p>
      <p>My preliminary observations revealed three key findings:</p>
      <p> Across all regions, prescribing rates declined gradually from 2020 to 2025, showing smooth and consistent trends with no major fluctuations. A recurrent bimodal seasonal pattern is also visible, marked by an initial peak in December, a drop in January, and a subsequent rise to a higher peak in March. Finally, clear regional differences emerge, with the South West showing the highest prescribing rate (about 21 per 1,000) and London the lowest (around 10 per 1,000).</p> 
      <p>These visual findings also raise several further questions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li> What factors are driving the overall decline in prescriptions across England? Are policy changes, clinical guidelines, or public awareness campaigns contributing to this decline? </li>
      <li> What explains the recurring seasonal peaks in December and March, across all regions? Are these seasonal trends driven more by healthcare system practices or actual fluctuations in patient demand?</li>
      <li>Why do prescribing rates vary regionally, with the South West being the highest and London the lowest? Geographically, the South West is generally more rural than London. Urban areas like London often involve demanding lifestyles (commuting, noise, and fast-paced living), yet stress alone may not necessarily lead to higher prescribing rates. It remains unclear how, and to what extent, regional demographics, healthcare access, socioeconomic factors, or other unmeasured variables influence these differences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s important to note that my observations so far have only compared prescriptions against the total list size across regions, focusing specifically on the regional level. Other options, such as practices, Sub-ICB locations, PCNs, or ICBs, can be selected for more stratified comparisons, as well as different parameters, including specific drugs or BNF sections.</p>
      <p>To gain more details on these sleep medications, I also explored “Trend for BNF sections”, in chapter 4 (Central Nervous System), under 4.1: <i>Hypnotics and anxiolytics </i>, examining individual prescribing items and spending across all practices in England. I noticed something striking for Temazepam. The trends in spending and prescribed items for this medication show a clear divergence between September 2020 and September 2022. While the volume of prescriptions (items) remained relatively high and stable, total spending on the drug declined sharply (Figure 4). From 2023 onward, spending increased substantially even as the number of items prescribed fell, indicating a significant change in the prescribing dynamic. Higher prescription volumes corresponding to lower spending seem counterintuitive, it would be interesting to explore the reasons or the story behind this... </p>
      <p class="mb-2">Like a child walking along the beach looking for hidden treasure, I began my first real exploration of the prescribing data with no expectations. It turned out to be an exciting experience, revealing interesting findings and questions worth looking into further - whether to inspire future research or to understand the reasons behind them. It was such an enjoyable and engaging exploration. <i>Thanks to OpenPrescribing - an open, rapid, and highly valuable platform for unlocking insights into prescribing practices, facilitating the identification of trends, variations, regional differences, and potential areas for intervention.</i></p>
